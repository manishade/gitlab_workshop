This repo contains two parts:
1. Sample demo code for building a custom docker image of a tiny flask application and deploying it to jfrog 
2. hands-on workshop code for building a custom docker image (to install a basic python utility) and releasing the same to jfrog. It also contains unit tests and code coverage analysis.
All of the above are meant to be executed on GitLab and uses the kaniko executor to perform docker functions contrary to the docker-in-docker (dind) concept on Jenkins
